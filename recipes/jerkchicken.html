    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This baked jerk chicken is not too sweet, not too spicy. I was on the hunt for a perfect jerk seasoning and ended
        up making my own blend. Hope you like it! </p>
    <p>This dish can take up to 3 hours and 40 minutes to prepare!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon dried minced garlic</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>2-3 lbs whold chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>0.25 cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix salt, allspice, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic, nutmeg, black pepper, ginger, cayenne pepper,
            cinnamon, and thyme in a large bowl; add chicken pieces and toss to coat with seasoning mix. Cover and
            marinate in the refrigerator, 2 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour vegetable oil into a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place chicken pieces skin-side up into the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until juices run clear
            and chicken is no longer pink near the bone, 1 hour 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near
            the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Turn the oven on to broil, and cook until the skin crisps, 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
